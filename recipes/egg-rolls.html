        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>16 cups Taiwanese cabbage
                <em>or green cabbage or savoy cabbage</em> (shredded)</li>
            <li>2 cups carrot (shredded)</li>
            <li>2 cups celery (shredded or finely chopped)</li>
            <li>3 scallions (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut, vegetable, or canola oil (plus more for frying)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon five spice powder (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups roast pork (char siu, shredded or diced)</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked shrimp (chopped, optional)</li>
            <li>1 package egg roll wrappers (about 24 pieces)</li>
            <li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the cabbage, carrots, and celery into the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes. Transfer the veggies to an ice bath and drain. Thoroughly squeeze out all the excess water from the vegetables (you can put the drained veggies in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out the water). This is a very important step because if the filling is too wet, you will have a wet filling and soggy egg rolls!</li>
            <li>Once dry, transfer the veggies to a large mixing bowl. Add the scallions, salt, sugar, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons oil, five spice powder (if using), white pepper, roast pork, and cooked shrimp (if using). Toss everything together. The filling is ready to be wrapped!</li>
            <li>To wrap the egg rolls, take a small fistful of filling, squeeze it a little in your hand until it is compressed together, and place it on the wrapper. The wrapping method is similar to that of a burrito. Just add a thin layer of egg to make sure it stays sealed. Line them up on a lightly floured surface, and continue assembling until you run out of ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, heat oil to 325°F/160°C. You don't need too much—just enough to submerge the egg rolls. Carefully place a couple egg rolls into the oil, and fry them for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil to make sure they fry evenly.</li>
            <li>Cool slightly and serve! Freeze leftovers in freezer bags and reheat them in the oven at 350°F/175°C, until crispy.</li>
        </ol>
